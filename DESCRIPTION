Description: SongEvo simulates the cultural evolution of quantitative 
    traits of bird song. SongEvo is an individual- (agent-) based model.
    SongEvo is spatially-explicit and can be parameterized with, 
    and tested against, measured song data. Functions are available 
    for model implementation, sensitivity analyses, parameter 
    optimization, model validation, and hypothesis testing.
